# Contributing to JavaToHtml

I'm really glad you're reading this, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Simple Rules

* Find a bug? Just ensure that the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* Write a patch that fixes a bug? Please let me know opening a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Will be a pleasure discuss and apply your code. Thanks a lot!

## Coding

* I'm using eclipse default formating to make a good code format, but it's not a requirement. Just have a try.
* To create new elements, with HTML5 support please, I use [W3C Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/) to check not implemented tags/attributes yet and get the description of each attribute to know what each one does
* Make some unit test to check the supported tags, attributes utilization and other specific things of your implementation

## Suggesting Enhancements / New Features

Same as finding a bug. Check GitHub issues and if it's a good idea, let's start coding!

## Documentation / Code Examples

You can make examples or improve the documentation pages to help others developers using this API. Please, let me know!
